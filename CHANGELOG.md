## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

[Commits](https://github.com/twitch-rs/twitch_api/compare/v0.6.1...Unreleased)

### Breaking changes

- MSRV: 1.77.0
- Requests for helix endpoints have been converted to take `Cow`s.
  This change means the `builder()` methods are harder to use, consider using the new methods on
  each request which provide the same functionality but with better ergonomics.
  See the top-level documentation for a endpoint for more examples.
- Crate name changed: `twitch_api2` -> `twitch_api`, also changed to new org `twitch-rs`
- All (most) types are now living in their own crate `twitch_types`
- Features for clients are now named after the client, e.g feature `reqwest_client` is now simply `reqwest`
- Fixed wrong type on `UserAuthorizationGrantV1::client_id`
- Removed `bits_voting_enabled`, `bits_per_vote` and `bits_votes` on `Create Poll` and `Poll`
- `Get Clips` takes and returns `ClipId` instead of a string
- Made `GetCustomRewardRedemptionRequest::reward_id` optional
- `typed-builder` is now optional and not enabled by default, enable feature `typed-builder` to use the `::builder()` methods
- Client ext methods that take a `IntoIterator<Item = T>` now takes a `IntoIterator<Item = impl Into<T>>`
- `Get Channel Information` can now take multiple ids
- Simplified lifetimes for `Client`. Fixes an issue where &'1 Thing<'static> where: Thing<'static> would wrongly lower '1 to be specific. See <https://github.com/twitch-rs/twitch_api/issues/236>
- `TeamInformation::thumbnail_url` is now optional (`Option<String>`).
- Made many structs & enums non exhaustive
- Renamed `GetBlockedTerms` -> `GetBlockedTermsRequest`
- Changed `SCOPES` on `helix::Request`, `pubsub::Topic` and `eventsub::EventSubscription` to be `twitch_oauth2::Validator`
- Updated `twitch_oauth2` dependency
- Added EventSub WebSocket support, changing many methods on transport and eventsub to take this into account.
- Removed `tmi` feature ([shut down in April 2023](https://discuss.dev.twitch.com/t/legacy-chatters-endpoint-shutdown-details-and-timeline-april-2023/43161))
